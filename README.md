## üìå Project Overview
The **Excel Report Generator** is a Spring Boot application that fetches data using **Spring Data JPA** and generates an Excel report with the help of **Apache POI**. The data is fetched from a database and transformed into an Excel file containing a workbook, sheet, rows, and cells. 

The report can be downloaded by making a `GET` request to a specific endpoint, which will generate the Excel file and return it as a downloadable attachment.
